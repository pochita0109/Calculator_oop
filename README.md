# Calculator in OOP

Calculator in Object-Oriented Proramming
- This program is a calculator that is written in object-oriented programming. This program have three files named: main program, user interface, and calculator.

Process:
1. Create three files; one is for user interface where we will create a class to ask the user on their inputs and print the outputs. Another one is for calculator, where we will create a class for calculator and to process the inputted two numbers and operations of user. And on for the main program where we will import the two classes from two files.
2. On the user interface file, create a class named user interface.
3. On the calculator file, create a class named calculator.
4. On the user interface class, ask the user to input their numbers and choose an operation (1 for addition, 2 for subtraction, 3 for multiplication, and 4 for division).
5. Import the two classes from two files and create two objects from the classes in the main program file.
6. In the calculator file, create an if, elif, and else statement for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
7. Import the input for first number, second number, and operation from user interface file to main program file.
8. Import the operations from calculator file to main program file and create an if, elif and else statement on it.
9. Print the answer.
10. On the user interface file, create a question where it will ask the user if he/she wants to continue using calculator or not.
11. If yes (Y), back from the start and if no (N), exit the program.
